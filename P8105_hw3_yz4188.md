## Problem 1

## Load data

    data("instacart")

The data has 1384617 observations, and 15 columns. Totally 20769255 data
points. Key variables: One observation is one product from a single
order, using `order_id` and `product_id` to identify one observation.
For example, providing order\_id=1 and product\_id=49302 will select the
first row of the original table. Aisle is a key variable to do analysis
based on aisle of each single observation.

## How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?

``` r
aisles = instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

There are 134 aisles, fresh vegetables is the most items ordered from.

## Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n, .desc=TRUE)) %>%
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

## Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>%
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank <= 3) %>%
  arrange(aisle,rank) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |

| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

## Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name,order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow, 
    values_from = mean)%>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| product\_name    |        0 |        1 |        2 |        3 |        4 |        5 |        6 |
|:-----------------|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77419 | 14.31579 | 15.38095 | 15.31818 | 15.21739 | 12.26316 | 13.83333 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44118 | 11.36000 | 11.70213 | 14.25000 | 11.55172 | 12.78431 | 11.93750 |

## Problem 2

## Data Cleaning

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
brfss = brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health", response %in% c("Excellent","Good","Very good","Fair","Poor")) %>%
  arrange(factor(response, levels = c("Poor","Fair","Good","Very good","Excellent")))
```

## In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about in 2010?

In 2002:

``` r
brfss_2002 = brfss %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  select(locationabbr, locationdesc) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  group_by(locationabbr) %>%
  filter(n() >= 7) %>%
  select(locationabbr) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  knitr::kable()
brfss_2002
```

| locationabbr |
|:-------------|
| CT           |
| FL           |
| MA           |
| NJ           |
| NC           |
| PA           |

In 2010:

``` r
brfss_2010 = brfss %>%
  filter(year == 2010) %>%
  select(locationabbr, locationdesc) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  group_by(locationabbr) %>%
  filter(n() >= 7) %>%
  select(locationabbr) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  knitr::kable()
brfss_2010
```

| locationabbr |
|:-------------|
| CA           |
| CO           |
| FL           |
| MD           |
| MA           |
| NE           |
| NJ           |
| NY           |
| NC           |
| OH           |
| PA           |
| SC           |
| TX           |
| WA           |

The results shows that in 2010, there are more states were observed at 7
or more locations than 2002.

## Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data\_value across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average value over time within a state.

``` r
brfss %>%
  filter(response %in% "Excellent") %>%
  select(year, locationabbr, data_value) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  unique() %>%
  group_by(locationabbr, year) %>%
  mutate(avg = mean(data_value)) %>%
  select(year, locationabbr, avg) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = locationabbr, color = locationabbr)) +
  labs(
    title = "Average data value over time within each states",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average Data Value") +
  guides(col=guide_legend("State"))
```

![](P8105_hw3_yz4188_files/figure-gfm/q2_plot1-1.png)<!-- -->

According to the plot, the average data value for each state drops
overtime.

## Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010, distribution of data\_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among locations in NY State.

``` r
brfss %>%
  filter(year %in% c(2006,2010), locationabbr == "NY") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = data_value, fill = response)) +
  geom_density()+
  facet_grid(cols = vars(year))
```

![](P8105_hw3_yz4188_files/figure-gfm/q2_plot2-1.png)<!-- -->

According to the plot, the range of data value for each kind’s of
response in 2010 is wider than the one in 2006.

## Proplem 3

## Load Data

``` r
accel = read_csv("data/accel_data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(weekday_weekend = recode(day,"Monday" = "weekday",
                                     "Tuesday"= "weekday",
                                     "Wednesday" = "weekday",
                                     "Thursday" = "weekday",
                                     "Friday" = "weekday",
                                     "Saturday" = "weekend",
                                     "Sunday" = "weekend",
                                    ))%>%
  select(day_id, week, day, weekday_weekend, everything()) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1 : activity_1440,
    names_prefix = "activity_",
    names_to = "activity",
    values_to = "activity_count"
  ) %>% 
  rename(minute = activity)
```

    ## Rows: 35 Columns: 1443

    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr    (1): day
    ## dbl (1442): week, day_id, activity.1, activity.2, activity.3, activity.4, ac...

    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Exiting variables are: day\_id, week, day, weekday\_weekend, minute,
activity\_count. There are 50400 observations.

## Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity over the day.

``` r
accel %>% 
  group_by(day_id, week, day) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(activity_count)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'day_id', 'week'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

According to the table, the total activity count on Saturday drops
apparently.

## Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of the day.

``` r
accel %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = as.numeric(minute), y = activity_count, color = day)) + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "24-hour activity time courses for each day ",
    x = "Time",
    y = "Activity Count"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    limits = c(0, 1440),
    breaks = c(0, 240, 480, 720, 960, 1200, 1440), 
    labels = c("12am", "4am", "8am", "12pm", "4pm", "8pm", "12am")
  )
```

![](P8105_hw3_yz4188_files/figure-gfm/q3_plot1-1.png)<!-- -->

According to the graph, the activity counts goes lower after 10pm. In
each day, activity counts are highter at near 8am, 12pm, 4pm, and 8pm.
